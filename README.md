# Danoi

This is an implementation of the classic puzzle game 'Towers of Hanoi'

The goal is to move the stack of plates from spot one to spot three. You can one move one plate at the time, and you cannot place a bigger plate on top of a smaller one.

select a stack with the arrow keys or A and D, and pick up / place down plates with SPACE

This is done mostly as an exercise in D.
